Applet does not run
</applet>

<p>***NOTE:*** <br>
For an unknown reason, this is running far slower when over the Internet than it does if all files are local to the user.  I am troubleshooting the problem and in the very worst case, the hosted files will be provided along with instructions on how to initialize the Applet.  Thank you for your patience.</p>
