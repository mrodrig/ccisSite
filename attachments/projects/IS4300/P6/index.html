      <li><a target="_blank" href="http://162.243.44.232/REV1/">Prototype (Website)</a> (Posted: 11/6/13 10:18PM)</li>
      <li> Startup Instructions:
        <p>This website was specifically developed/tested using Google Chrome.  Please use that web browser for your heuristic evaluation. To begin, click on the Prototype (Website) link above.  The Briefing document and Task Scenarios can be found below.</p>
        <p>Note: Please login using the following credentials:
          <pre>
          Username: foo
          Password: bar
          </pre>
          Please be sure to delete any sample tasks that you may have created during the heuristic evaluation so that any subsequent users will find the prototype with an empty task list as you should have found the interface.  If the interface has any tasks in the list that are not related to the scenarios provided, please delete these prior to beginning those tasks.
        </p>

          Note: I apologize if the system does not respond immediately or something does not load.  It appears to be due to some network maintenance that DigitalOcean is performing on their NYC2 data center. Reloading the page usually fixes the issue(s).

        Instead of using October 24th, 2013 and October 31st, 2013 for the two dates specified in the task scenarios, please use November 11th, 2013 and November 18th, 2013 respectively.
