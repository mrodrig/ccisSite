                    <p>Hi, I am currently an Undergraduate at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. Some of the classes that I have already completed or am currently enrolled in include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li ng-repeat="course in courses">{{course}}</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I completed my first Co-op at EMC Corporation in August 2013. The next Co-Op that I will be able to go out on starts January, 2015 and ends in June, 2015.  I was very excited to be able to work for a company and gain valuable experience. It was a great experience and I learned a lot at EMC. The initial job responsibilities include Time to Failure (TTF) testing on hard and solid state drives. When I noticed there was a possibility of improving the process utilized in running these tests, I explored those alternatives and presented my work to my co-workers. They were thoroughly impressed and eventually expanded my job responsibilities to include multiple additional programming responsibilities. If you would like to see some of the projects that I worked on at EMC, please look at my resume.  It was a great experience to work for and pe part of such an innovative company. For my second Co-op, I accepted an offer for my second Co-op at MITRE Corporation.  I was able to learn a significant amount about AngularJS, NodeJS, Agile Software Development, and even lead my team's daily stand-up meetings.</p>
